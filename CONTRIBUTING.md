# How to contribute

Patches and contributions are welcome. There are a few guidelines to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives Google
permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

*   If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual
    CLA][].

*   If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][].

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

[individual CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual
[corporate CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate

Once your CLA is submitted (or if you already submitted one for another Google
project), make a commit adding yourself to the `AUTHORS` and `CONTRIBUTORS`
files. This can be part of your first commit.
